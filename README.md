- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lightsound/tanstack-start-start.git
cd tanstack-start-start

# Install dependencies (git hooks are automatically set up)
bun install

# Start development server
bun run dev
```

## Scripts

| Command         | Description                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `bun run dev`   | Start development server             |

| `bun run check` | Run linter and formatter check       |
| `bun run fix`   | Auto-fix lint issues and format code |

## VS Code Configuration

### Recommended Extension

This project recommends installing the [oxc extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oxc.oxc-vscode) for the best development experience.

### Editor Settings

The included `.vscode/settings.json` provides the following configurations:

- **Format on Save**: oxfmt automatically formats your code when you save a file
- **Read-only Files**: The following files are set to read-only to prevent accidental edits:
  - `**/*.md` — Markdown files should be managed by AI, not edited directly
  - `bun.lock` — Auto-generated lockfile, should not be manually modified
  - `**/routeTree.gen.ts` — Auto-generated by TanStack Router, should not be manually modified

## About oxlint Configuration

This starter uses **minimal oxlint rules** with only the `correctness` category enabled. This catches obvious bugs without being intrusive, allowing you to customize the rules according to your project's needs.

You can make the linting stricter by adding more categories to `.oxlintrc.json`:

```json
{
  "categories": {
    "correctness": "error",
    "suspicious": "warn",
    "perf": "warn"
  }
}
```

Available categories: `correctness`, `suspicious`, `perf`, `style`, `pedantic`, `restriction`, `nursery`

## Git Hooks with Lefthook

This starter uses [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) for managing git hooks:

- **pre-commit**: Runs linting and format check on staged files (fast)
- **pre-push**: Runs the full `check` script before pushing (complete)

Git hooks are automatically installed when you run `bun install`.

## Developer Tools

In development mode, this starter includes [TanStack Router DevTools](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/devtools) for debugging routes and navigation. The DevTools panel appears in the bottom-right corner of your application.
